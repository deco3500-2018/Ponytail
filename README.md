# How to deploy the prototype

## Deploy the prototype with Unity application
1. Download the package called CloudDogInterface.
2. Start Unity, find the "open" button, open the project called 'CloudDogInterface'.
3. All the files include code, graphics and sences can be checked right now.

## Use the prototype in Windows
1. Download the package called CloudDogInterface.
2. Launch the exe file called 'Prototype 2.exe' in CloudDogInterface\Build.
3. Choose any screen resolution but must choose windowed. 
4. Resized the window like the resolution of a phone. (eg.720 x 1280)

## Use the prototype in Mac
1. Download the package called CloudDogInterface.
2. Launch the file called build in CloudDogInterface\Build.app\Contents\MacOS.
 (Not sure because the prototype have not been used in Mac, but we built this)

## Use the prototype in Andorid Phone
1. Download the file called CloudDogDemo4.apk and Ardog.apk from your Andorid Phone.
2. Install and run.

### How to build and run in Andorid while using Unity
1. File -> Build & Run, make sure your Unity already has Andorid package for building.
2. Edit -> Preference -> External Tool
3. Import your JDK
4. Import your SDK, the path should be C:\Users\**username**\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk
5. Connect your Andorid device with USB cable then click build & run.
6. Put the camera on the Target image. If you have not printed the paper, you can display the target images on your phone.

### Note:
Run ARDog needs an envirnment, it's very complex to set up if you are the first time to use it. You must import AR support files by yourself instead of downloading the whole project files. Therefore, we do not put ARdog function with the interface together. If the ARcore has any error on your computer, the whole project cannot run includes the CloudDogInterface. But the team has built apk file already, you can install apk in any Andorid device.
